Hi Alit
My name is กิตติพงษ์, from Thailand
I am on backend team as well
I joined the team a couple weeks back.
My background is actually Python but this project is based on Scala so now, basically, I work and learnin parallel.
Last but not least, welcome to the team and in case that you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me
[even if the rest of the team might me able to give you a better answer compared to myself]
